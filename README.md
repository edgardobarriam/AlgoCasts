# AlgoCasts

Companion repo to [The Coding Inteview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/)

My Approach:
- use the first solution that comes to my mind
- use any available properties or methods built-in into standard js
- use as little instructions/lines as possible
- avoid RegEx if possible
- exercise is considered completed if it passes all tests
